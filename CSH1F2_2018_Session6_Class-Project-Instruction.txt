Term:		2018/2019
Subject:	CSH1F2
Subject Name:	Introduction to Computer Science
Topic:		Session 6
Theme:		Class Project



Instruction:

This session (Week 6) we wil try to see an implementation of data visualization (data representation) in the area of Smart Cities.

You are free to choose and use other materials for comparison and learning improvement.

We will use and embrace the media below:
	Python as our language technology (view only)
	Kagggle.com as code sharing 


The class project below will typically take around 15 to 45 minutes end to end, 

please make sure you are running on a computer with minimal background processes and sufficient RAM (4GB with small number of background processes in Windows 10 Operating System) and CPU (Intel Core i5 or better), because the notebook sometimes could cause your CPU fan to swirl fast.

Lets move it on:


1 Prepare your local repository:

	1a Enter the branch that you created in Session 2 by entering the folder in your computer and do : git checkout <your_student_id>
		attention: 
		please use the directory / folder that you have been working on since Session 2.
		if you use a new directory or folder or new computer, you have to follow the Git initiation and related process before you start working, and I dont cover the related support in this session.

	1b Do the following in your working branch inside your local repository from Session 2 : git pull origin master 

		
2 Follow the instruction below: 

	2a open https://www.kaggle.com/wti200/exploratory-analysis-nyc-taxi-trip
		it is an example of how citizen or public can dig down into exploration of city taxi trips, in this case New York City taxi.

	2b try to analyze graphs in "Feature Visualization" and "Feature Engineering" sections.
	
	2c answer questions below in this file and submit maximum by 21.00 (09.00 PM) UTC+07.00 at 03 October 2018 (today, in 1 hour):

	2d submit by issueing: git push origin <your_student_id>

	2e Back to master branch in local repository to make sure you will be ready like a bread fresh from the oven: git checkout master

Answer for	: What do you think the meaning of "Feature " in this notebook ? 		(20 to 40 words)	(20 points)

		The feature is this notebooks means it's an attribute that we could use in the notebook
		.....................................

Answer for	: What do you see in the relation between trip and time in this notebook ? 	(40 to 100 words)	(40 points)

		trip and time are increases gradually as time passes by so it can be really beneficial for the taxi driver
		so the longer the trip means it took a longer time to get to their destination. Meaning more money the taxi driver make

Answer for	: Search Google, what are different types of data analysis ? 			(40 to 100 words)	(40 points)

		There are 6 different types. they are Descriptive, Exploratory, Inferential, Predictive, Causal, and mechanistic

Answer for	: What do you think the meaning of "Feature " in this notebook ? 		(20 to 40 words)	(20 points)

		I think this feature analyzes a visualization and engineering of the duration of riding a taxi in NYC, such as knowing the ratio between the average duration of a person's journey in general and the number of riders.

Answer for	: What do you see in the relation between trip and time in this notebook ? 	(40 to 100 words)	(40 points)
		I see the relationship between travel and time is found in most people prefer to use a taxi at 15-16 pm. Because maybe in NYC, the time to go home from work around this time, so of course at this time the peak was at the peak of people taking a taxi.

Answer for	: Search Google, what are different types of data analysis ? 			(40 to 100 words)	(40 points)
		
		1) Descriptive technique. An analytical technique that is used to analyze data by describing or describing data that has been collected soberly without any intention to make generalizations from the results of the research. Included in the analysis 
		   techniques are descriptive statistics such as presenting data into graphs, tables, percentages, frequencies, diagrams, graphs, mean, mode etc.
		2) Inferential technique. Is a statistic used to analyze data by making generally accepted conclusions. The characteristics are the use of certain statistical formulas, then the results of calculations that have been done are what will become the
		   basis for making generalizations.
